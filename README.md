A simple chat application.

To start the Application -

2. Make sure you have Reactjs and Nodejs installed in your system.
3. Now open the directory of api in a terminal, and run "npm install".
4. Similarly, open the web directory and run "npm install".
5. To run the Web Application, run "npm start" in the same terminal.
6. To run APIs, run "npm run dev" for running it in development mode. It also requires nodemon to be installed in your system.
7. Go to your browser abd type URL: "localhost:3000" and you will see the Welcome Page for the application.

Enjoy !
